Signal Name,Remarks
CLKIN1/CLKIN2,CLKIN1 and CLKIN2 are input pins without internal pull-up and pull-down. An external 10K pull-down resistor is recommended if they are not used.
NC,These signals are No Connect (NC) and should be unconnected in the application.
ONOFF,"A brief connection to GND in the OFF mode causes the internal power management state machine to change the state to ON. In the ON mode, a brief connection to GND generates an interrupt (intended to be a software-controllable power-down). A connection to GND for a period of time longer than the value configured in the BBNSM_CTRL[BTN_TIMEOUT] causes a forced OFF (PMIC_ON_REQ output 'L'), as long as there is no pending RTC alarm event or tamper event."
POR_B,"POR_B has no internal pull-up/down resistor, requires external RTC pull-up resistor to NVCC_BBSM_1P8. It is recommended that POR_B is properly handled during power up/down. Please see the EVK design for details."
RTC_XTALI/RTC_XTALO,"To hit the exact oscillation frequency, the board capacitors must be reduced to account for the board and chip parasitics. The integrated oscillation amplifier is self-biasing but relatively weak. Care must be taken to limit the parasitic leakage from RTC_XTALI and RTC_XTALO to either the power or the ground (> 100 MΩ). This de-biases the amplifier and reduces the start-up margin. If you want to feed an external low-frequency clock into RTC_XTALI, the RTC_XTALO pin must remain unconnected or driven by a complementary signal. The logic level of this forcing clock must not exceed the NVCC_BBSM_1P8 level and the frequency shall be < 50 kHz under typical conditions."
XTALI_24M/XTALO_24M,"The system requires 24 MHz on XTAL/XTALO. The crystal cannot be eliminated by an external 24 MHz oscillator. If this clock is used as a reference for ALI/XTALO, then there are strict frequency tolerance and jitter requirements. See Clock sources and relevant interface specifications chapters for details."
