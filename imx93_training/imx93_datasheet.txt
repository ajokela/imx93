================================================================================


Part number nomenclature—i.MX 93 processors:


Figure 1 describes the part number nomenclature so that characteristics of a specific part number can be identified (e.g., cores, frequency, temperature grade, fuse options, and silicon revision). The primary characteristic which describes which data sheet applies to a specific part is the temperature grade (junction) field. The document explains the different temperature grades and their corresponding data sheets for commercial, industrial, extended industrial, and automotive products. It also provides guidance on ensuring the proper data sheet is used by verifying the temperature grade field and matching it to the appropriate data sheet.

================================================================================
3.1 Unused input and output guidance (Page 9)
================================================================================


Table 3. Special signal considerations:

  Signal Name: CLKIN1/CLKIN2
  Remarks: CLKIN1 and CLKIN2 are input pins without internal pull-up and pull-down. An external 10K pull-down resistor is recommended if they are not used.

  Signal Name: NC
  Remarks: These signals are No Connect (NC) and should be unconnected in the application.

  Signal Name: ONOFF
  Remarks: A brief connection to GND in the OFF mode causes the internal power management state machine to change the state to ON. In the ON mode, a brief connection to GND generates an interrupt (intended to be a software-controllable power-down). A connection to GND for a period of time longer than the value configured in the BBNSM_CTRL[BTN_TIMEOUT] causes a forced OFF (PMIC_ON_REQ output 'L'), as long as there is no pending RTC alarm event or tamper event.

  Signal Name: POR_B
  Remarks: POR_B has no internal pull-up/down resistor, requires external RTC pull-up resistor to NVCC_BBSM_1P8. It is recommended that POR_B is properly handled during power up/down. Please see the EVK design for details.

  Signal Name: RTC_XTALI/RTC_XTALO
  Remarks: To hit the exact oscillation frequency, the board capacitors must be reduced to account for the board and chip parasitics. The integrated oscillation amplifier is self-biasing but relatively weak. Care must be taken to limit the parasitic leakage from RTC_XTALI and RTC_XTALO to either the power or the ground (> 100 MΩ). This de-biases the amplifier and reduces the start-up margin. If you want to feed an external low-frequency clock into RTC_XTALI, the RTC_XTALO pin must remain unconnected or driven by a complementary signal. The logic level of this forcing clock must not exceed the NVCC_BBSM_1P8 level and the frequency shall be < 50 kHz under typical conditions.

  Signal Name: XTALI_24M/XTALO_24M
  Remarks: The system requires 24 MHz on XTAL/XTALO. The crystal cannot be eliminated by an external 24 MHz oscillator. If this clock is used as a reference for ALI/XTALO, then there are strict frequency tolerance and jitter requirements. See Clock sources and relevant interface specifications chapters for details.

The page discusses the boot device interface allocation for the i.MX 93 Applications Processor. It supports three kinds of boot devices: Primary Boot Device, Recovery Boot Device, and Serial Download Boot Device. The primary boot device is selected by Boot Config pins in Normal Boot or Internal Fuses Boot mode. Valid options for the primary boot device include SD/eMMC/FlexSPI NOR/FlexSPI NAND. The recovery boot device is only from SPI1/2/3/4. Both Cortex-M33 and Cortex-A55 support serial download download mode via USB1. The tables list the interfaces used for booting through FlexSPI and uSDHC1.
